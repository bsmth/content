Every four weeks, the Firefox team releases a new stable version of the browser, and two kinds of release notes are published.
Firefox release notes are published on [firefox.com](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/notes/) and describe what's new from a user's perspective, such as features, performance improvements, and fixes that improve everyday browsing.

The Firefox release notes for developers listed below are created by the MDN content team and focus on **developer-facing changes**.
They highlight new or updated web platform features, APIs, and tools that developers can use to build for the modern web.
These notes help you stay up to date with new standards and capabilities as they become available in Firefox.
