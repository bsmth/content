The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to [mark up text in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) to give it structure and meaning.

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic heading and paragraph elements.

The finished example should look like this:

```html live-sample___basic-text1-finished
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
    <h2>The Llama</h2>
    <p>
      Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a
      web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
    </p>
    <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
    <p>
      The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly
      by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
    </p>
  </main>
</body>
```

```css live-sample___basic-text1-finished
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1,
h2 {
  color: purple;
}

p {
  color: gray;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text1-finished")}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___basic-text1
Basic HTML Animals This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our
animals. The Llama Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch
of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she
goes. The Anaconda The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page,
travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
```

```css live-sample___basic-text1
h1,
h2 {
  color: purple;
}

p {
  color: gray;
}
```

This task covers understanding of HTML headings and paragraphs. Ideally the answer should look something like this:

```html
<h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

<p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

<h2>The Llama</h2>

<p>
  Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web
  page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
</p>

<h2>The Anaconda</h2>

<p>
  The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by
  way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
</p>
```

It doesn't make sense for the subheadings to be a higher level than the top-level heading, or for the paragraphs to be marked up with something other than `<p>`.

</details>

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to turn the first un-marked up list into an unordered list, and the second one into an ordered list.

The finished example should look like this:

```html live-sample___basic-text2-finished
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Looking at lists</h1>
    <p>
      Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Broccoli</li>
      <li>Asparagus</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First knock on the door</li>
      <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>
      <li>Wait for at least 5 seconds</li>
      <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
    </ol>
  </main>
</body>
```

```css live-sample___basic-text2-finished
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

ul {
  border: 2px solid orange;
}

ol {
  border: 2px solid purple;
}

ol,
ul {
  padding: 5px 20px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text2-finished")}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___basic-text2
<h1>Looking at lists</h1>

<p>Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.</p>

Cucumber Broccoli Asparagus Pepper

<p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>

First knock on the door When prompted, say the magic word Wait for at least 5
seconds Turn the handle and push
```

```css live-sample___basic-text2
ul {
  border: 2px solid orange;
}

ol {
  border: 2px solid purple;
}

ol,
ul {
  padding: 5px 20px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text2")}}

In task 2 the student needs to wrap the first list in a `<ul>` element, and the second list in a `<ol>`. The individual list items for both lists need to be wrapped in `<li>` elements.

The finished code should look like this:

```html
<h1>Looking at lists</h1>

<p>Turn the following list of my favorite vegetables into an unordered list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cucumber</li>
  <li>Broccoli</li>
  <li>Asparagus</li>
  <li>Pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Turn the following directions into an ordered list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First knock on the door</li>
  <li>When prompted, say the magic word</li>
  <li>Wait for at least 5 seconds</li>
  <li>Turn the handle and push</li>
</ol>
```

## Task 3

In this task, you are provided with a paragraph, and your aim is to use some inline elements to mark up a couple of appropriate words with strong importance, and a couple with emphasis.

The finished example should look like this:

```html live-sample___basic-text3-finished
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>
    <p>
      There are
      <strong> two </strong>
      things I care about —
      <strong> music </strong>
      and
      <strong> friends </strong>
      . Someday I
      <em> might </em>
      be able to get my friends interested in each other,
      <em> and </em>
      my music!
    </p>
  </main>
</body>
```

```css live-sample___basic-text3-finished
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1,
strong {
  color: purple;
}

em {
  color: gray;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text3-finished")}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___basic-text3
<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

<p>
  There are two things I care about — music and friends. Someday I might be able
  to get my friends interested in each other, and my music!
</p>
```

```css live-sample___basic-text3
h1,
strong {
  color: purple;
}

em {
  color: gray;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text3")}}

The last task aims to test understanding of using basic inline elements such as `<strong>` and `<em>`. Simply, the student needs to markup a couple of words appropriately using each one.

The final code should look like this:

```html
<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

<p>
  There are two things I care about — <strong>music</strong> and
  <strong>friends</strong>. Someday I <em>might</em> be able to get my friends
  interested in each other, <em>and</em> my music!
</p>
```
