## Form structure 1

In this task we want you to structure the provided form features:

1. Separate out the first two and second two form fields into two distinct containers, each with a descriptive legend (use "Personal details" for the first two, and "Comment information" for the second two).
2. Mark up each text label with an appropriate element so that it is semantically associated with its respective form field.
3. Add a suitable set of structural elements around the label/field pairs to separate them out.

```html live-sample___form-structure1
<form>
  Name:
  <input id="name" name="name" type="text" />

  Age:
  <input id="age" name="age" type="number" />

  Comment:
  <input id="comment" name="comment" type="text" />

  Email:
  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" />
</form>
```

The only task in this test your skills assessment looks at your knowledge of simple form structure. You are asked to:

1. Separate out the first two and second two form fields into two distinct containers, each with a descriptive legend (use "Personal details" for the first two, and "Comment information" for the second two). This is what the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements are made for.
2. Mark up each text label with an appropriate element so that it is semantically associated with its respective form field. This needs the `<label>` element, and the `for` attribute if you are choosing not to wrap the `<label>` around the `<input>`.
3. Add a suitable set of structural elements around the label/field pairs to separate them out. Ordered/unordered lists would be ideal, but something like `<div>`s would also be acceptable.

The finished markup should look something like this:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Personal details</legend>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <label for="age">Age:</label>
        <input type="number" id="age" name="age" />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Comment information</legend>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <label for="comment">Comment:</label>
        <input type="text" id="comment" name="comment" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <label for="email">Email (include if you want a reply):</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
      </li>
    </ul>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```
