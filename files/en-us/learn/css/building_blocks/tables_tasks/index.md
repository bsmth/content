The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to [style HTML tables in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables).

## Task

In the lesson on [styling tables](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables) we styled up a table in a rather garish manner. In this task, we are going to style the same table, but using some good practices for table design as outlined in the external article [Web Typography: designing tables to be read not looked at](https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables/).

Our finished table will look like the image below. There are a number of ways that you can achieve this, but we suggest you follow similar patterns as used in the tutorial to do the following things:

- Add padding of `0.3em` to the table headings and data and align them at the top of their cells.
- Align headings and data for columns containing numbers right.
- Align headings and data for columns containing text left.
- Align the heading of the table footer right.
- Align the data of the table footer left.
- Add a 1px top and bottom solid border with the hex color `#999` to the table.
- Add a 1px top solid border with the hex color `#999` to the footer.
- Remove the default spacing between the table elements borders to get the expected result.
- Stripe every odd row of the main table with the hex color `#eee`.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___table
<table>
  <caption>
    A summary of the UK's most famous punk bands
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Band</th>
      <th scope="col">Year formed</th>
      <th scope="col">No. of Albums</th>
      <th scope="col">Most famous song</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Buzzcocks</th>
      <td>1976</td>

```css live-sample___table

```

{{EmbedLiveSample("table")}}

Additional question:

- What can you do to make the table layout behave a bit more predictably? Think of how table columns are sized by default and how we can change this behavior to size the columns according to the width of their headings.
