The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Working with JSON](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) article.

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions by downloading the code and putting it in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
> If there is an error, it will be logged in the results panel on the page or into the browser's JavaScript console to help you.
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## JSON 1

The one and only task in this article concerns accessing JSON data and using it in your page. JSON data about some mother cats and their kittens is available in [sample.json](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/tasks/json/sample.json). The JSON is loaded into the page as a text string and made available in the `catString` parameter of the `displayCatInfo()` function. Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the `displayCatInfo()` function to store:

- The names of the three mother cats, separated by commas, in the `motherInfo` variable.
- The total number of kittens, and how many are male and female, in the `kittenInfo` variable.

The values of these variables are then printed to the screen inside paragraphs.

Some hints/questions:

- The JSON data is provided as text inside the `displayCatInfo()` function. You'll need to parse it into JSON before you can get any data out of it.
- You'll probably want to use an outer loop to loop through the cats and add their names to the `motherInfo` variable string, and an inner loop to loop through all the kittens, add up the total of all/male/female kittens, and add those details to the `kittenInfo` variable string.
- The last mother cat name should have an "and" before it, and a full stop after it. How do you make sure this can work, no matter how many cats are in the JSON?
- Why are the `para1.textContent = motherInfo;` and `para2.textContent = kittenInfo;` lines inside the `displayCatInfo()` function, and not at the end of the script? This has something to do with async code.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```js live-sample___json1
const section = document.querySelector("section");

let para1 = document.createElement("p");
let para2 = document.createElement("p");
let motherInfo = "The mother cats are called ";
let kittenInfo;
const requestURL =
  "https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/tasks/json/sample.json";

fetch(requestURL)
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((text) => displayCatInfo(text));

function displayCatInfo(catString) {
  let total = 0;
  let male = 0;

  // Add your code here

  // Don't edit the code below here!

  para1.textContent = motherInfo;
  para2.textContent = kittenInfo;
}

section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

The one and only task in this article concerns accessing JSON data and using it in your page. JSON data about some mother cats and their kittens is available in [sample.json](sample.json). The JSON is loaded into the page as a text string and made available in the `catString` parameter of the `displayCatInfo()` function, called when the provided promise chain (which starts by fetching the JSON data) is fulfilled. Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the `displayCatInfo()` function to store:

- The names of the three mother cats, separated by commas, in the `motherInfo` variable.
- The total number of kittens, and how many are male and female, in the `kittenInfo` variable.

The values of these variables are then printed to the screen inside paragraphs.

Some hints/questions:

- The JSON data is provided as text inside the `displayCatInfo()` function. You'll need to parse it into JSON using the `JSON.parse()` method.
- You'll probably want to use an outer loop to loop through the cats and add their names to the `motherInfo` variable string, and an inner loop to loop through all the kittens, add up the total of all/male/female kittens, and add those details to the `kittenInfo` variable string.
- The last mother cat name should have an "and" before it, and a full stop after it. How do you make sure this can work, no matter how many cats are in the JSON?
- Why are the `para1.textContent = motherInfo;` and `para2.textContent = kittenInfo;` lines inside the `displayCatInfo()` function, and. not at the end of the script? This has something to do with async code.

Your code should look something like this:

```js
function displayCatInfo(catString) {
  let total = 0;
  let male = 0;

  // Add your code here
  const cats = JSON.parse(catString);

  for (let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
    for (const kitten of cats[i].kittens) {
      total++;
      if (kitten.gender === "m") {
        male++;
      }
    }

    if (i < cats.length - 1) {
      motherInfo += `${cats[i].name}, `;
    } else {
      motherInfo += `and ${cats[i].name}.`;
    }
  }

  kittenInfo = `There are ${total} kittens in total, ${male} males and ${
    total - male
  } females.`;

  // Don't edit the code below here!

  para1.textContent = motherInfo;
  para2.textContent = kittenInfo;
}
```
