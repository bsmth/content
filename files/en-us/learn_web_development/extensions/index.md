Our **Extension modules** constitute useful additional skills to learn as web developers start to expand their knowledge and develop specialisms.

## Prerequisites

While there is no specific prequisite knowledge for starting any of these modules, it is advisable that you work through our [Core modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core) first, if you are a newcomer to web technologies. 

In particular, if you've never done any coding before, we'd recommend the [Your first website](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) module, which introduces you web technologies very gently and takes you through the process of building a simple website.

## Modules

- [Advanced JavaScript objects](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Advanced_JavaScript_objects)
  - : Having a deeper knowledge of how JavaScript objects work is useful as you build confidence with web development, start to build more complex apps, and create your own libraries. This module will help you by providing JavaScript object theory and object-oriented programming practice.
- [Client-side web APIs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs)
  - : **Application Programming Interfaces** (**APIs**) are programming features for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or manipulating data from other websites or services. This module covers common aspects of some of the most common classes of Web APIs that we haven't previously covered in any kind of detail, providing a useful grounding for those who want to go deeper into browser API usage.
- [Asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS)
  - : In this module, we take a look at {{Glossary("asynchronous")}} {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.
- [Transform and animate CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Transform_animate)
  - : Animations are a vital part of a good user experience. Subtle usage can make page designs more interesting and appealing, and also enhance usability and perceived performance.
