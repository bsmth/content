This module introduces you to the practicalities of web development. You'll gather the assets and write the code to construct a simple webpage, then publish it for the world to see.

It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make your own simple website online, so we'll start there.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes no prior knowledge of web technologies, but you should already be comfortable with using your operating system, including using the file system and browsing the web. You should have a code editor and multiple web browser installed.

If this is not the case, we'd suggest that you run through the [Environment setup](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup) module first.

In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.

- [Publishing your sample code](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Publishing_your_website)
