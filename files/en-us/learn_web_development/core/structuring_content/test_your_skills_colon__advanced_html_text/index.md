The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to use [lesser-known HTML elements to mark up advanced semantic features](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features).

> [!NOTE]

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows:

- Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility).
- Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.
- Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
- Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text.

The finished example should look like this:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___advanced-text2
<h1>Advanced text semantics</h1>

<p>Let's start with a quote:</p>

<p>
  HTML, Hypertext Markup Language is by default accessible, if used correctly.
</p>

<p>CSS can also be used to make web pages more, or less, accessible.</p>

<p>Chemical Formulae: H2O (Water), C2H6O (Ethanol).</p>

<p>
  Dates: December 25th 2019 (Christmas Day), November 2nd 2019 (DÃ­a de los
  Muertos).
</p>
```

```css live-sample___advanced-text2
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 0;
  color: purple;
}

p {
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}

abbr,
time {
  color: green;
}
```
