## Task 1

In this task, we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic heading and paragraph elements.

The finished example should look like this:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/basic-text/basic-text1-finished.html", '100%', 300)}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html live-sample___basic-text1
Basic HTML Animals This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our
animals. The Llama Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch
of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she
goes. The Anaconda The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page,
travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
```

```css live-sample___basic-text1
h1,
h2 {
  color: purple;
}

p {
  color: gray;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("basic-text1")}}
