CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need for now, including syntax, features, and techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in [Installing basic software](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Installing_software)), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in [Dealing with files](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Dealing_with_files)). You should also be familiar with HTML (work through our [Structuring content with HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) module if not).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
