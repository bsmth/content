Our **Core modules** cover topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using appropriate tools.

## Prerequisites

While there is no prequisite knowledge for starting this set of modules, we would recommend that you familiarize yourself with your computer, make sure you've got a basic set of required applications installed (such as web browsers and a code editor), and do some background reading on the web and web technologies, if you have no already done so. All these topics are covered in our [Getting started modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started).

In particular, if you've never done any coding before, we'd recommend the [Your first website](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) module, which introduces you web technologies very gently and takes you through the process of building a simple website.

## Modules

- [Structuring content with HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)
  - : To build a high-quality, usable, accessible website, you need to understand how to define your content structure using semantic HTML. This module covers the basics of the HTML language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.
- [CSS styling basics](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics)
  - : CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need for now, including syntax, features, and techniques.
- [CSS text styling](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling)
  - : With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
