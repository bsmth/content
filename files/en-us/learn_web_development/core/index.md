Our **Core modules** cover topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using appropriate tools.

## Prerequisites

While there is no prequisite knowledge for starting this set of modules, we would recommend that you familiarize yourself with your computer, make sure you've got a basic set of required applications installed (such as web browsers and a code editor), and do some background reading on the web and web technologies, if you have no already done so. All these topics are covered in our [Getting started modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started).

In particular, if you've never done any coding before, we'd recommend the [Your first website](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website) module, which introduces you web technologies very gently and takes you through the process of building a simple website.

## Modules

- [Structuring content with HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)
